# firmware

Embedded firmware source and build artifacts for kittybot devices.

## Contents

- MCU firmware modules
- board support configuration
- flashing/build notes

## Troubleshooting

- If board support files are unclear, add a board matrix document under `docs/`.
- If build scripts are missing, keep them scoped to this directory to avoid cross-layer coupling.
